Hi! everyone and all techies. This is my insight on the Palmora Group Human Resources Analysis. 
In this analysis, I was able to take a number of steps in order to showcase my insight. Some steps taken are as follows:
1) I started by cleaning the data based on instructions and discretion as follows:
   a. I created a a generic field name as undisclosed being a category of gender that was not made available.
   b. Those employees without salary are assumed to no longer work with the company as such, they had to be deleted
   c. Also, departments indicated as "NULL" were taken out too.
   d. Other irrelevant fields were deleted as well
2) First case, Show gender distribution in the organisation as distilled to regions and departmehts; the following were arrived at as follows:
   a.  Departments          Female               Male  
        Accounting            8                   16
        Business Development  9                    7                 
        Engineering           12                  12
        Human Resources       14                  11
        Legal                  9                  19
        Marketing              9                   7
        Product Management    14                  18
        Research Development   9                   8
        Sales                 14                  10
        Services              11                   7
        Support               14                  16
        Training              10                  6
   
   3) Insights were also given on ratings based on gender as follows:
                            Female                Male
      Very good              44                   32
      Good                   82                   73
      Average                180                  203
      Poor        -          49                   64
      Very poor              19                   31
      
   4) Analyse the company's salary structure by identifying a gender pay gap based on department and regions(i.e location), these are as follows:
      We got a gender pay gap in the regions and departments, and so the management are to focus on the following:
      a. Abuja- Accounting, Business Development, Legal, Marketing, Research & Development, Sales, Support, Training
      b. Kaduna - Engineering, Human Resources, Legal, Marketing, Research & Development, Sales, Services, Training
      c. Lagos - Marketing, Product Managment, Research & Development, Sales, Services, Support, Training

  5) Does Palmoria meet the requirement of a $90,000.00 minimum pay? Answer is No because 556 employees are paid less than $90,000.00 and only 257 employees are paid more than $90,000.00
  6) The amount to be paid as bonuses to individual employees are reflected in the chart report
  7) The total amount to be paid to individual employees (Salary inclusive of bonus) are reflected in the chart report
  8) Total Amount to be paid out per region and company-wide is reflected in the chart report through my github link supplied
